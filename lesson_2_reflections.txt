What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Or else it would track your entire computer. Not just the folders you want.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is where I am still writing code. While staging area is the files that are ready to be commited when saved.
